# {Hack(H)er413}
We are a 24-hour women and non-binary student empowering hackathon hosted at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Amherst, Massachusetts. In 2024, our event ran from February 17th to 18th at the University of Massachusetts Amherst Integrative Learning Center. The hackathon provided new and returning hackers with the opportunity to gain new technical skills from workshops, network with our sponsor company representatives, find a community of like-minded peers in tech, and compete in various prize categories.

## Event Summary

Each year, our team aims to support women and non-binary students as they jump start their careers in tech, whether they are picking up coding for the first time or returning to our hackathon to network and compete in new prize categories. In 2024, we had our keynote speaker, Tosin Durotoye, speak directly to students about her journey to becoming an innovation and social impact leader with 18+ years of public and private sector management experience across global and emerging markets and underserved communities. We also introduced more beginner friendly technical skill-building workshops along with several professional development workshops ranging from “Creating and Pitching Your Tech Start-Up” to “How to Maximize Your Internship/Job Search.” It was important for us to incorporate GitHub education into our workshop schedule for all of the beginner-level students attending our event for the first time. We had two GitHub education workshops, one run by one of our own UMass student organizations, CICSoft, called “GitHub 101” that dove into the world of GitHub in an interactive-style workshop setting. It was designed for beginners and demystified the fundamentals of version control while illustrating the pivotal role of GitHub in collaborative software development. The second GitHub education workshop was run by our MLH coach, Alina Momin, titled “Intro to GitHub Copilot.” This taught students how to use GitHub Copilot to speed up their development time and make building projects more enjoyable. Our mentors assisted our participants in the usage of GitHub for their projects, showing them how to collaborate with their team members effectively, with our project submission requiring a link to the project on GitHub for judging.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The grant funds we were awarded went towards purchasing prizes for our participants. Each year we aim to spend around $1000 in prizes to support student work at Hack(H)er413. In 2024, we struggled to obtain new sponsors and feared for our budget cuts making their way to the prize categories we offer annually. Because of the GitHub Education Grant, we were able to expand our number of prize categories and award students for successful projects in these categories. Not only did we not have to cut down our budget for prizes, we were able to purchase over $2000 in prizes. Our participants were more motivated to attend workshops and learn how to collaborate on a project using GitHub because of the exciting, high quality prizes we had to offer them in 2024. This also helped us attract more participants during our application period, gaining us over 100 new hackers in comparison to our numbers in 2023. 
## Top Projects

Several projects stood out in 2024, with the top projects winning the Best Software and Best Hardware Hack categories. Our 2024 Best Hardware Hack was awarded to “Roomba More Smarter,” an extended variant of the Open Interface protocol for the Roomba. Rather than throwing old Roombas away, this hack allows users to integrate older Roombas with newer features, including internet capabilities, smarter path planning algorithms, direct control of the device, and fun capabilities such as dancing and music playback (Roomba More Smarter on Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/roomba-more-smarter). Our 2024 Best Software Hack winner was “PerfectPitch,” a website that leverages artificial intelligence to empower individuals, providing them with tailored feedback, script assistance, and mock interview simulations in order to help them ace their next interview (PerfectPitch on Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/perfectpitch-47vojk). These projects used GitHub to show steady progress over the course of 24 hours to our judges during the judging process.

## What’s Next?
Overall, 2024 was a great year for Hack(H)er413! We saw an increase in participation numbers by around 100 people. We were able to offer more beginner resources this year, allowing us to support people approaching tech for the first time. We offered a career fair and other professional development opportunities, such as workshops, to help students jump start their careers in the tech industry. We spent over $2000 to award student success for various hardware and software projects with the help of the GitHub Education Grant. We were able to deliver 2 GitHub workshops that taught beginners how to get started on collaborating with their teammates to create a project. From the 400+ hackers that showed up to the event, we received 44 project submissions. We were able to provide the necessary environment and resources for our participants to feel empowered and find their community at Hack(H)er413. We aim to do the same in 2025, while offering even more resources and educational opportunities to help increase equity in the tech community. The next Hack(H)er413 takes place on February 15th-16th, 2025. For more information on our upcoming event, you can follow us on Instagram @hackher413.
